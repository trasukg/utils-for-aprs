/**
  This is an "Endpoint" that attempts to make a connection to a TCP KISS
  device, e.g. an instance of the DireWolf soundcard modem.

  Once enabled (by calling 'enable()'), the endpoint attempts to make a connection
  to the host and port that have been set into its properties.

  It will emit 'connect' and 'disconnect' events when it makes and/or loses a
  connection.  If the initial connection fails, or the connection is lost, the
  endpoint waits for a certain period of time (default 5s, configured by retryTime),
  and then attempts to reconnect.

  The 'connect' event delivers a KISSConnection object that represents the
  connection. It scans the input for properly-framed KISS packets, removing any
  byte-stuffing as required.  When a KISS frame is received, the endpoint emits a
  'data' event, with the received frame as the argument.  A KISS frame can be sent
  down the connection by calling the connection's 'data' method.

  The connection machine state table calls this function when the

  is wrapped around the actual connection, and then emit a 'connect' event that
  passes the KISSConnection object as its argument.  Clients can then subscribe
  to either 'data' events on the KISSConnection to receive frames.  They can
  also call 'data(frame)' on the KISSConnection to send a frame.  When the
  connection gets closed, it will emit a 'closed' event, so the client knows to
  stop using it.

  When data arrives on the underlying port, it should be passed through the
  kissFrameParser, such that the connection object emits a 'data' event that
  contains the unescaped KISS frame, with the command header stripped.
