"utils-for-aprs": patch

Update dependencies to remove some vulnerabilities. Any that remain are in the dev dependencies. They are results of including gulp-jsdoc3, which hasn't been updated for quite a while.  At some point, we'll look at how to generate documentation in some modern way, probably removing gulp entirely, but they are no harm at the present time.
